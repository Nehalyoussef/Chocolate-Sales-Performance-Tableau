# 🍫 Chocolate Sales Performance Dashboard (Tableau)

## Project Overview
This project presents an **interactive sales performance dashboard for global chocolate sales**, designed to track revenue across countries, evaluate **top-performing sales representatives**, and analyze **shipment distribution** worldwide.

The dashboard helps stakeholders understand regional sales performance, identify high-impact salespeople, and gain insights into logistics and product demand using clear, data-driven visualizations.

## Tools Used
- Tableau  
  - Interactive dashboard design  
  - Calculated fields and aggregations  
  - Filters and visual-level interactivity  
  - Geographic (map-based) visualizations  
- Sales analytics and performance analysis concepts

## Dataset Description
- **Type:** Chocolate sales transaction data  
- **Scope:** Global, multi-country sales records  
- **Key attributes include:**
  - Country  
  - Sales representative  
  - Chocolate product type (e.g., dark & pure variants)  
  - Sales amount  
  - Boxes shipped  
  - Transaction count  

The dataset represents **global chocolate sales activity**, commonly used in analytics practice to demonstrate sales performance tracking, regional comparison, and logistics analysis.
